# Student Record Management System (SRMS) 
Requirements covered:
1) Arrays            -> Recent activity cache (fixed-size) + temp buffer during file load
2) Linked Lists      -> Main storage of students (dynamic list)
3) Stack             -> Undo last operation (Add / Update / Delete)
4) Queue             -> Student service requests (FIFO)
5) BST               -> Fast search by Student ID (maps ID -> linked-list node)

Optional (Bonus): File handling (Save/Load)
